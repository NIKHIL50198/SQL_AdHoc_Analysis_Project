# Problem Statement  
Atliq Hardwares, a leading computer hardware manufacturer based in India with a global presence, is seeking to enhance its data analytics capabilities. The management has observed a lack of sufficient insights for making swift, data-driven decisions. To address this, they plan to expand their data analytics team by recruiting several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, the Data Analytics Director, aims to find candidates proficient in both technical and interpersonal skills. To evaluate these abilities, he has organized a SQL challenge.

## 1. ASK  
Director: Mr. Tony Sharma 

### Questions:  
- Provide the list of markets in which customer "Atliq Exclusive" operates its business in the APAC region.
- What is the percentage of unique product increase in 2021 vs. 2020? The final output contains these fields : unique_products_2020, unique_products_2021 & percentage_chg.
- Provide a report with all the unique product counts for each segment and sort them in descending order of product counts? The final output contains 2 fields: segment & product_count.
- Follow-up: Which segment had the most increase in unique products in 2021 vs 2020? The final output contains these fields: segment, product_count_2020, product_count_2021 & difference.
- Get the products that have the highest and lowest manufacturing costs? The final output should contain these fields: product_code, product & manufacturing_cost.
- Generate a report which contains the top 5 customers who received an average high pre_invoice_discount_pct for the fiscal year 2021 and in the Indian market. The final output contains these fields: customer_code, customer & average_discount_percentage.
- Get the complete report of the Gross sales amount for the customer “Atliq Exclusive” for each month. This analysis helps to get an idea of low and high-performing months and take strategic decisions. The final report contains these columns: Month, Year & Gross sales Amount.
- In which quarter of 2020, got the maximum total_sold_quantity? The final output contains these fields sorted by the total_sold_quantity, Quarter & total_sold_quantity.
- Which channel helped to bring more gross sales in the fiscal year 2021 and the percentage of contribution? The final output contains these fields: channel, gross_sales_mln & percentage.

### Data Storage:
[Resume Project Challenge 04] The public dataset is completely available on the Code basis website platform where it stores and consolidates all available datasets for analysis. The specific individual datasets at hand can be obtained at this link below: https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge  

### Data Organized:
The dataset is taken from the AtliQ. Thanks to the AtliQ for providing datasets for public access which is a great learning asset - feel free to explore them here. This dataset contains only gdb023' (atliq_hardware_db) database and 1 text file (meta_data)


## 3. PROCESS  
### Tools Used:
1. MySQL
2. Power BI

### Data Used:
dim_customers, dim_product, fact_gross_price, fact_manufacturing_cost, fact_pre_invoice_deductions, fact_sales_monthly  

### About Data:  
This file provides a comprehensive overview of the tables found in the 'gdb023' (atliq_hardware_db) database. It includes information for six main tables:

1. dim_customer: contains customer-related data

5. fact_pre_invoice_deductions: contains pre-invoice deductions information for each product
6. fact_sales_monthly: contains monthly sales data for each product.

Column Description for dim_customer table:
1. customer_code: The 'customer_code' column features unique identification codes for every customer in the dataset. These codes can be used to track a customer's sales history, demographic information, and other relevant details.
